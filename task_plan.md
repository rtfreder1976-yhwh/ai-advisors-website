## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Niche First: Cleaning** | "The Riches are in the Niches." We start with one to build the case study fast. |
| **Expansion Strategy** | Once the "Cleaning Snapshot" is proven, we simply copy/paste it for **Landscaping, HVAC, and Pest Control**. |
| **Productized Service Model** | High ticket + standardized delivery = scalable revenue without linear time cost. |
| **Programmatic SEO** | Replaces manual SEO labor. Generates local authority at scale. |
| **Native GHL AI (vs Vapi)** | Simpler setup, lower cost ($0.02/msg), better calendar integration, no complex webhooks. |
| **Astro for Web** | Performance + Content Collections make it perfect for pSEO. |
| **GoHighLevel (GHL)** | The delivery engine. Simplifies "Ops" to "Snapshot Copy". sticky MRR. |

## Future Verticals (The "Copy-Paste" Roadmap)
1.  **Landscaping/Lawn Care** (High recurrence, identical booking flow).
2.  **Pressure Washing/Detailing** (High ticket, visual testimonials).
3.  **Pest Control** (Subscription model, urgent need).
4.  **HVAC/Plumbing** (Very high ticket, emergency response focus).
