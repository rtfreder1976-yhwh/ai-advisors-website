# Video Script: Peer-to-Peer Demo (The "Anti-Agency" Loom)

**Format:** Screen recording (Loom/OBS). Face cam in bottom corner.
**Tone:** Casual, respectful, "Business Owner to Business Owner." No hype words.
**Length:** 2-3 Minutes max.

---

## 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
*   **Visual:** Start on your Google Ads or Facebook Ads manager (or a screenshot of one), or just a spreadsheet showing "Ad Spend."
*   **Audio:**
    "Hey guys, I wanted to show you something kind of interesting. Like a lot of you, I've been spending about [Amount] a month on ads to get cleaning jobs. And honestly, it works okay, but the cost per lead just keeps creeping up."
*   **Action:** Switch tabs to your GoHighLevel "Conversations" tab (blur out customer names).
    "So last month, I decided to turn the ads off completely and try something different. I wanted to see if I could get my *own* website to actually generate leads for free."

## 2. The "Neighborhood" Strategy (0:30 - 1:15)
*   **Visual:** Show your Astro Website. Scroll down to the Footer or "Locations" page. Click on a specific, wealthy neighborhood page (e.g., "Carpet Cleaning [Rich Neighborhood]").
*   **Audio:**
    "The secret wasn't targeting the whole city. It was targeting specific neighborhoods. I used a tool to automatically build out these pages—one for every single neighborhood we service. There's like 50 of them."
*   **Action:** Highlight the specific H1 tag (e.g., "Best Cleaning in [Neighborhood]").
    "Google loves these because they're super specific. When someone in [Neighborhood] searches for 'cleaners near me,' we pop up right at the top now."

## 3. The Automation (1:15 - 2:00)
*   **Visual:** Show a GHL Conversation where the AI booked a job.
*   **Audio:**
    "But the traffic is only half the battle. If I miss the call, I lose the money. So I plugged in this simple AI text bot."
    "Watch this—this came in at [Time]. I was actually [doing something else/asleep]. The customer asked for a quote, the bot asked 2 qualifying questions, and bam... booked directly onto my calendar."
*   **Visual:** Click to the "Calendar" view to show the booked appointment.

## 4. The Offer (2:00 - 2:45)
*   **Visual:** Back to your face (cam only) or a simple Notepad with bullet points.
*   **Audio:**
    "Anyway, I'm not an agency, I just run my cleaning business. But a couple of guys in my local networking group asked if I could set this up for them."
    "I turned the whole thing into a 'snapshot'—basically a copy/paste template. It has the website structure, the AI bot, and the calendar settings."
    "I'm looking for maybe 3 or 4 other business owners who want to test this out. I'm not trying to charge [Agency Price], I just want to get some case studies to see if it works as well for you as it did for me."
    "If you want to see if it'll work in your area, just shoot me a DM or comment 'System' below and I'll send you the details. Cheers."
