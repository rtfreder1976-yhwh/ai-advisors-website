# Outreach Scripts: "The Anti-Agency Approach"

**Strategy:** You are NOT an agency. You are a business owner who "cracked the code" and is sharing the system.
**Target Audience:** Cleaning Business Owners, Maid Service Groups, Local BNI Groups.

## Option A: The "Accidental Discovery" (Best for FB Groups)
**Headline:** I stopped running Ads in December. Bookings went UP.

**Body:**
Hey guys, long time lurker.
Like most of us, I was burning about $1,500/mo on LSA and Facebook ads. The leads were okay, but half of them were tire kickers or "price shoppers."

I decided to try something weird for Q1.
I built a system that automatically generates "Service Area Pages" for every single neighborhood we serve (about 50 of them).
Then I plugged in a simple AI text bot to catch missed calls instantly.

**The Result:**
- We rank #1 for "Cleaning [Neighborhood Name]" in 12 areas now.
- The AI booked 4 jobs while I was asleep last week.
- Ad Spend: $0.

I'm packaging this up into a snapshot because a few local friends asked for it. 
Looking for 3 other owners who want to test it out (at cost) in exchange for a case study testimonial.

Drop a "System" below if you want to see the demo video.
(Not selling anything here, just showing what worked).

## Option B: The "Visual Proof" (Best for Image/Video Posts)
*[Attach multiple screenshots of your Astro site: The "Locations" page and a specific "Neighborhood" page]*

**Caption:**
Does anyone else ignore "Service Area" pages? I used to.
I thought "House Cleaning [City]" was the only keyword that mattered.
Turns out, "Deep Cleaning [Rich Neighborhood]" converts 5x better (and has zero competition).

I just built a tool that spins up these pages for every zip code in my territory automatically.
It’s feeding our GHL account with leads that cost $0.

I'm opening up 5 spots to set this up for other cleaning biz owners next week.
If you're already using GoHighLevel, I can just zap the snapshot to you.

DM me "Neighborhood" and I'll send the details.

## Option C: The Cold DM (Direct & Respectful)
*Use this only on warm leads or people asking about marketing.*

"Hey [Name], saw your post about lead costs going up.
I own a cleaning biz too, and we completely pivoted away from ads to 'Neighborhood SEO' recently. It’s been a game changer for margins.
I actually productized the setup for a few friends. If you're open to it, I can send you a quick 2-min video showing how we automate the landing pages.
No pressure, just thought it might help!"

## Handling Replies
*   **They say "System"**: Reply with "Sent you a DM!" (Then DM the Case Study Link).
*   **They ask "How much?"**: "For the Alpha group, I'm doing the full setup for $2.5k (usually $5k) just to get the testimonials. That includes the Site, the AI Agent, and the GHL Snapshot."
