    question: "What does AI training for employees include?",
    answer: "Our AI employee training covers practical skills your team can use immediately: ChatGPT and generative AI fundamentals, prompt engineering techniques, AI-powered writing and analysis, workflow automation basics, and responsible AI use policies. Every session includes hands-on exercises using your actual business scenarios, not generic examples."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ChatGPT training in Huntsville?",
    answer: "Yes! We provide on-site ChatGPT training throughout Huntsville, Madison, and the Research Park area. Our Huntsville AI training workshops are popular with defense contractors, tech companies, and professional services firms. We can train teams at your office or arrange a local venue for larger groups."
  },
  {
    question: "What about AI training in Florence and the Shoals?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We're based in the Shoals and offer AI training workshops in Florence, Muscle Shoals, Tuscumbia, and Sheffield. Local businesses benefit from same-day availability and no travel fees. We also serve Decatur, Athens, and surrounding North Alabama communities."
  },
  {
    question: "How long is a typical AI training workshop?",
    answer: "Workshop lengths vary by depth: Intro sessions run 2-3 hours and cover AI basics plus hands-on ChatGPT practice. Half-day workshops (4 hours) dive deeper into prompt engineering and specific use cases. Full-day intensives cover comprehensive AI literacy, multiple tools, and department-specific applications. Multi-week programs provide the deepest training with ongoing practice and support."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you train our team on specific AI tools we already use?",
    answer: "Yes, we customize training around your existing tech stack. Whether you're using ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, Jasper, or industry-specific AI tools, we'll tailor the curriculum to maximize your team's proficiency with the platforms you've already invested in."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the ROI of AI training for small businesses?",
    answer: "Most businesses see immediate productivity gains: teams trained on ChatGPT typically save 5-10 hours per week on writing, research, and analysis tasks. One Florence law firm reduced document drafting time by 60% after our training. A Huntsville marketing agency cut content creation time in half. The training typically pays for itself within the first month through time savings alone."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer remote AI training options?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer both on-site and remote training. Remote sessions work well for distributed teams or businesses outside our immediate service area. However, we find on-site training in Huntsville, Decatur, Florence, and Athens produces better results due to hands-on interaction and real-time problem-solving with your actual workflows."
