  {
    question: "What does AI implementation include?",

We handle the technical complexity so you can focus on results."
  },
  {

The goal is instant response + persistent follow-up without manual effort."
  },

    question: "Do you build AI chatbots for websites?",
    answer: "Yes, we develop custom AI chatbots that can be embedded on your website, integrated with Facebook Messenger, deployed via SMS, or all of the above.
