  {
    question: "Why do AI systems need ongoing support?",
    answer: "AI systems require maintenance for several reasons: business processes evolve, tools and APIs update, training data needs refreshing, and optimization opportunities emerge from real-world usage data. Without ongoing attention, AI performance degrades over time. Support ensures your automations keep working smoothly and continue improving based on actual results."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in AI system optimization?",
    answer: "Optimization includes analyzing performance data (conversation logs, completion rates, response times), refining prompts and responses based on real interactions, A/B testing different approaches, updating training data, and implementing improvements. We look at what's working, what's not, and systematically improve your AI's effectiveness."
  },
  {
    question: "How often do you review AI system performance?",
    answer: "We monitor systems continuously and provide monthly performance reports. Quarterly strategy reviews offer deeper analysis and planning sessions. For clients with high-volume AI usage, we can provide weekly optimization cycles. The right frequency depends on your usage volume and how critical AI is to your operations."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my AI automation breaks?",
    answer: "Support clients get priority response times—typically same-business-day for critical issues. We diagnose the problem, implement fixes, test thoroughly, and restore functionality. We also conduct root cause analysis to prevent similar issues. For non-support clients, we offer break-fix services at hourly rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer support for AI systems you didn't build?",
    answer: "Yes, we can take over support for AI implementations done by other providers. We'll start with an assessment to understand your current setup, identify any immediate issues, and establish monitoring. This is common for businesses whose original consultant is no longer available or wasn't providing adequate support."
  },
  {
    question: "What do quarterly strategy reviews cover?",
    answer: "Quarterly reviews include: performance analysis of all AI systems, ROI assessment (time saved, leads generated, etc.), identification of new AI opportunities, technology updates and recommendations, roadmap planning for the next quarter, and alignment with your evolving business goals. It's your chance to ensure AI continues delivering value as your business grows."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does ongoing AI support cost?",
    answer: "Support packages are typically structured as monthly retainers ranging from $300-1,500/month depending on the complexity and volume of your AI systems. This includes monitoring, maintenance, optimization, and support hours. Most clients find the cost pays for itself through improved AI performance and avoided downtime. We'll recommend an appropriate package during your consultation."
