    question: "What is AI consulting for small business?",
    answer: "AI consulting helps small businesses identify opportunities to use artificial intelligence to improve operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. It includes analyzing your current processes, finding high-impact AI use cases, and creating a practical roadmap for implementation. Unlike enterprise consultants, we focus on affordable, practical solutions that small businesses in Huntsville, Florence, and North Alabama can actually implement."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does AI consulting cost in Huntsville?",
    answer: "AI consulting costs vary based on project scope, but Singing River AI is specifically designed to be affordable for small businesses—not enterprise pricing. Initial strategy assessments typically range from $1,500-$5,000 depending on complexity. We always start with a free 30-minute consultation to understand your needs and provide a custom quote. Many North Alabama businesses find our rates 50-70% lower than larger consulting firms."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes you the best AI consultant in Florence and the Shoals?",
    answer: "We're local, affordable, and practical. Unlike national firms or remote consultants, we're based right here in the Shoals. We understand the local business landscape, can meet in person, and focus on solutions that work for Alabama small businesses—not Fortune 500 companies. Our 24+ years of technology experience combined with deep AI expertise means you get enterprise-quality consulting at small business prices."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an AI consulting engagement take?",
    answer: "Initial strategy and assessment typically takes 2-4 weeks, including stakeholder interviews, process analysis, and deliverable development. Simple assessments for smaller businesses can be completed in 1-2 weeks. Comprehensive AI transformation roadmaps for larger organizations may take 4-6 weeks. We'll provide a clear timeline during your free consultation based on your specific situation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need AI consulting before implementing AI?",
    answer: "Not always, but it often saves money and prevents mistakes. If you have a clear, simple AI use case (like automating email responses), you might go straight to implementation. But if you're unsure where to start, have multiple potential applications, or want to ensure you're investing wisely, consulting first typically delivers 3-5x ROI by avoiding wrong turns and identifying the highest-impact opportunities."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you provide AI consulting for in North Alabama?",
    answer: "We serve all industries but have deep experience with real estate, professional services (law firms, CPAs, consultants), home services contractors (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), healthcare practices, and defense/aerospace companies in the Huntsville area. Our strategies are customized to your industry's specific challenges, compliance requirements, and competitive landscape."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with AI strategy for defense contractors in Huntsville?",
    answer: "Yes. We understand the unique requirements of defense contractors and aerospace companies in Huntsville and the Research Park area. Our AI consulting addresses compliance considerations, security requirements, and the specific workflow challenges these organizations face. We help identify AI opportunities that improve efficiency while maintaining the documentation and process controls your contracts require."
