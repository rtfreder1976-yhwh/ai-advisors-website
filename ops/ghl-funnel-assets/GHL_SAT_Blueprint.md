## 2. Page Content & Copy Strategy

### Section 1: The Hero (State Change)
*   **Headline:** How to Dominate Voice Search in [City Name] Without Lifting a Finger.
*   **Sub-headline:** Stop being invisible to Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. We fix the data fragmentation that's killing your local lead flow—guaranteed.
*   **Element:** Video Sales Letter (VSL)
    *   *Autoplay (Muted):* Enabled.
    *   *Script Focus:* Interrupt the "PDF proposal" pattern. Agitate the pain of being "digitally dead" if not found via voice.
*   **CTA Button:** [YES, SECURE MY RANKINGS] (Scrolls to Pricing)

### Section 2: Agitating the "Pain" (The Hell)
*   **Header:** Your Business is Currently Invisible to 50% of Your Market.
*   **Copy:** Every time a potential customer asks Siri "Find [Service] near me," a decision is made in milliseconds. If your Apple Maps data is fragmented or unverified, you don't exist. 
*   **Visual:** `voice_search_before_after.png` (Showing 'Location Not Found' vs 'Verified & Visible')
*   **Key Points:**
    *   **The Suspension Threat:** Inconsistent data triggers Google manual reviews. One wrong digit can lead to a "Digital Death Sentence."
    *   **The Competitor Theft:** While you wait, your competitors are claiming your territory.

### Section 3: The Mechanism (Perceived Likelihood)
*   **Header:** The Voice Search Synchronization Protocol.
*   **Copy:** We don't use automated "overlays" that hide the problem. We use **Manual Forensic Citation Cleanup**.
*   **Feature List:**
    *   **Manual Apple Business Connect Verification:** We log in and lock your data directly with Apple.
    *   **Bing Places Native Priority:** Ensuring Alexa knows exactly who you are.
    *   **The Suspension Shield:** Active monitoring to block "Suggest an Edit" attacks.

### Section 4: The Offer Stack (Massive Value)
*   **Visual:** `value_stack_graphic.png`
